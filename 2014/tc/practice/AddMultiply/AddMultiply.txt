Problem Statement

You are given an inty.
We are looking for any int[]xthat satisfies the following constraints:xhas exactly three elements(x[0] *x[1] ) +x[2] =yEachx[i] must be between -1000 and 1000, inclusive.Nox[i] can be equal to 0 or 1.Find and return one suchx.If there are multiple valid solutions, you may return any of them.
You may assume that for our constraints ony(specified below) at least one validxalways exists.  

Definition

Class:  AddMultiply  

Method:  makeExpression  

Parameters:  int  

Returns:  int[]  

Method signature:  int[] makeExpression(int y)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Constraints

-  ywill be between 0 and 500, inclusive.  

Examples

0)  

6

Returns: {2, 2, 2 }

2*2 + 2 = 6Note that this is one of many possible solutions. Another solution is:3*3 + (-3) = 6  

1)  

11

Returns: {2, 3, 5 }

2)  

0

Returns: {7, 10, -70 }

Note that 0 and 1 are not allowed, thus a result like 0 * 0 + 0 would be incorrect.  

3)  

500

Returns: {-400, -3, -700 }

Some or all of the returned numbers may be negative.  

4)  

2

Returns: {2, 2, -2 }

5)  

5

Returns: {5, 2, -5 }
