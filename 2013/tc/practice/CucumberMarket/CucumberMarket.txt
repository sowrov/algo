1110

3

Returns: "YES"

There are 4 choices.

If he chooses cucumbers 0, 1, and 2, the total price will be 1000+1+10 = 1011 yen.If he chooses cucumbers 0, 1, and 3, the total price will be 1000+1+100 = 1101 yen.If he chooses cucumbers 0, 2, and 3, the total price will be 1000+10+100 = 1110 yen.If he chooses cucumbers 1, 2, and 3, the total price will be 1+10+100 = 111 yen.The result is "YES", because Cucumber Boy can buy any set ofkunique cucumbers.

1)  

{1000,1,10,100}

1109

This case is the same as the example 0, except for the value ofbudget.

1110 yen is greater than the budget therefore the result is "NO".
