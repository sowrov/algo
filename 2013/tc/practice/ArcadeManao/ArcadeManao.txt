Problem Statement

You might remember the old computer arcade games. Here is one about Manao.The game level is an NxM grid of equal cells. The bottom of some cells has a platform at which Manao can stand. All the cells in the bottommost row contain a platform, thus covering the whole ground of the level. The rows of the grid are numbered from 1 to N starting from the top and the columns are numbered from 1 to M starting from the left. Exactly one cell contains a coin and Manao needs to obtain it.Initially, Manao is standing on the ground, i.e., in the bottommost row. He can move between two horizontally adjacent cells if both contain a platform. Also, Manao has a ladder which he can use to climb. He can use the ladder to climb both up and down. If the ladder is L units long, Manao can climb between two cells (i1, j) and (i2, j) if both contain a platform and |i1-i2| <= L. Note that Manao carries the ladder along, so he can use it multiple times. You need to determine the minimum ladder length L which is sufficient to acquire the coin.Take a look at the following picture. On this level, Manao will manage to get the coin with a ladder of length 2.You are given a int[]levelcontaining N elements. The j-th character in the i-th row oflevelis 'X' if cell (i+1, j+1) contains a platform and '.' otherwise. You are also given intscoinRowandcoinColumn. The coin which Manao seeks is located in cell (coinRow,coinColumn) and it is guaranteed that this cell contains a platform.Return the minimum L such that ladder of length L is enough to get the coin. If Manao can perform the task without using the ladder, return 0.  

Definition

Class:  ArcadeManao  

Method:  shortestLadder  

Parameters:  String[], int, int  

Returns:  int  

Method signature:  int shortestLadder(String[] level, int coinRow, int coinColumn)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Notes

-  Manao is not allowed to fall. The only way in which he may change his vertical coordinate is by using the ladder.  

Constraints

-  levelwill contain N elements, where N is between 1 and 50, inclusive.  

-  Each element oflevelwill be M characters long, where M is between 1 and 50, inclusive.  

-  Each element oflevelwill consist of '.' and 'X' characters only.  

-  The last element oflevelwill be entirely filled with 'X'.  

-  coinRowwill be between 1 and N, inclusive.  

-  coinColumnwill be between 1 and M, inclusive.  

-  level[coinRow- 1][coinColumn- 1] will be 'X'.

The example from the problem statement.  

1)  

{"XXXX",
 "...X",
 "XXXX"}

1

Returns: 1

Manao can use the ladder to climb from the ground to cell (2, 4), then to cell (1, 4) and then he can walk right to the coin.  

2)  

{"..X..",
 ".X.X.",
 "X...X",
 ".X.X.",
 "..X..",
 "XXXXX"}

3

Returns: 4

With a ladder of length 4, Manao can first climb to cell (5, 3) and then right to (1, 3).  

3)  

{"X"}

1

Returns: 0

Manao begins in the same cell as the coin.  

4)  

{"XXXXXXXXXX",
 "...X......",
 "XXX.......",
 "X.....XXXX",
 "..XXXXX..X",
 ".........X",
 ".........X",
 "XXXXXXXXXX"}
