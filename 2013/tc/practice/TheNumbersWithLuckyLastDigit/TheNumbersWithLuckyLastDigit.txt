Problem Statement

John believes that the digits 4 and 7 are lucky, and all other digits are unlucky.
A positive integer is called a lucky number if its last digit is lucky.
For example, 4, 14 and 207 are lucky numbers, while 40, 741 and 3 are not lucky numbers.
John would like to represent the intnas a sum of only lucky numbers, and he would like to do this using the minimal possible number of summands.
Return the number of summands in the representation, or -1 if it is impossible to achieve the goal.
