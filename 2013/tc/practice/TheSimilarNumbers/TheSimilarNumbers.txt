Problem Statement

Two positive integers A and B are calledsimilarif A <= 10*B and B <= 10*A. For example, 1 and 10 are similar, but 1 and 11 are not.You are given intslowerandupper. You must select as many integers as possible so that:each selected integer is betweenlowerandupper, inclusive;no two selected integers are similar.Return the maximum number of selected integers.  

Definition

Class:  TheSimilarNumbers  

Method:  find  

Parameters:  int, int  

Returns:  int  

Method signature:  int find(int lower, int upper)  

(be sure your method is public)
