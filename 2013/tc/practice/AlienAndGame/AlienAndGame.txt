Problem Statement

Alien Fred wants to destroy the Earth.
But before he does that, he wants to play the following game.

He has a rectangular board divided into unit cells.
Each cell is initially painted black or white.
You are given a String[]board.
The characterboard[i][j] represents the cell with coordinates (i, j).
Each of those characters is either 'B' (representing a black cell) or 'W' (representing a white cell).
The game is played in turns.
In each turn Fred can choose any row of the board and repaint all black cells of the row to white, and vice versa.
(Note that he can only select rows, not columns. 
Formally, he can choose an index i and change all characters ofboard[i].)

Fred wants to have a large white square somewhere on his board.
The sides of Fred's square must be parallel to the sides of the board.
The white square may be a part of a larger white area. 
(I.e., the cells that touch the square may be both black and white.)
Find a sequence of turns that produces the largest possible white square somewhere on the board, and return the area of that square.

Definition

Class:  AlienAndGame  

Method:  getNumber  

Parameters:  String[]  

Returns:  int  

Method signature:  int getNumber(String[] board)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Constraints

-  boardwill contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.  

-  Each element ofboardwill contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.  

-  Each element ofboardwill contain the same number of characters.  

-  Each character in each element ofboardwill be either 'B' or 'W'.  

Examples

0)  

{"BB",
 "WW"}

Returns: 4

The optimal strategy is to repaint row 0. After this change the entire board will be white, and thus we have a 2*2 white square.  

1)  

{"W"}

Returns: 1

Sometimes the optimal strategy requires no repainting.  

2)  

{"WBBB",
 "WBBB",
 "WWWW"}

Returns: 9

We should repaint row 0 and then repaint row 1. 
The resulting board will contain a 3*3 white square (in rows 0-2 and columns 1-3).  

3)  

{"W",
 "B",
 "W",
 "W",
 "W"}

Returns: 1

4)  

{"BWBBWBB",
 "WWBWWBW",
 "BBBBBBW",
 "WBBBBWB",
 "BBWWWWB",
 "WWWWWWW",
 "BBWWBBB"}

Returns: 9
