Problem Statement

Manao has recently invented a brand new single-player game called The Number Game.The player starts with a numberA. Also, another numberBis chosen. Note that neitherAnorBcontain a zero digit in their base 10 representation.The player's goal is to obtainBfromA. In each move, the player can either reverse his current number, or he can divide it by 10 (using integer division).
For example, if the current number is 12849, the player can either reverse it to obtain 94821, or he can divide it by 10 to obtain 1284. (Note that we always rounddownwhen using integer division.)You are given two intsAandB. If it is possible to obtainBfromA, return the minimum number of moves necessary to reach this goal. Otherwise, return -1.  

Definition

Class:  TheNumberGameDiv2  

Method:  minimumMoves  

Parameters:  int, int  

Returns:  int  

Method signature:  int minimumMoves(int A, int B)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Constraints

-  Awill be between 1 and 999,999,999, inclusive.  

-  Bwill be between 1 and 999,999,999, inclusive.  

-  AandBwill not contain a zero digit in base 10 representation.  

-  AandBwill be distinct.  

Examples

0)  

25

5

Returns: 2

Initially, the player has number 25 and needs to obtain 5. He can reverse the number and obtain 52, then divide it by 10 and obtain 5.  

1)  

5162

16

Returns: 4

To obtain 16 from 5162 in four moves, the player can perform the following sequence of moves:Reverse the number and obtain 2615.Divide 2615 by 10 and obtain 261.Reverse 261 and obtain 162.Divide 162 by 10 and obtain 16.Note that this is not the only possible sequence of four moves which leads to the goal.  

2)  

334

12

Returns: -1

There is no way to obtain 12 from 334.  

3)  

218181918

9181
