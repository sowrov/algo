Problem Statement

Consider the function SSR (Squared Sum of square Roots) defined on two positive integer parameters: SSR(A, B) = (sqrt(A)+sqrt(B))^2. We are interested in the cases when the value of the function is also an integer.Given intsNandM, return the number of ordered pairs (A, B) such that 1 <= A <=N, 1 <= B <=Mand SSR(A, B) is an integer.  

Definition

Class:  TheSquareRootDilemma  

Method:  countPairs  

Parameters:  int, int  

Returns:  int  

Method signature:  int countPairs(int N, int M)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Notes

-  The answer to the problem is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer type under the given constraints.  

Constraints

-  Nwill be between 1 and 77,777, inclusive.  

-  Mwill be between 1 and 77,777, inclusive.  

Examples

0)  

2

2

Returns: 2

Out of the four possible pairs (A, B), only two yield an integer result: SSR(1, 1) = 4 and SSR(2, 2) = 8.
On the other hand, SSR(1, 2) = SSR(2, 1) = 3+2*sqrt(2), which is not an integer.  

1)  

10

1

Returns: 3

SSR(1, 1), SSR(4, 1) and SSR(9, 1) are integers.  

2)  

3

8

Returns: 5

The valid pairs are (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 8) and (3, 3).  

3)  

100

100

Returns: 310
