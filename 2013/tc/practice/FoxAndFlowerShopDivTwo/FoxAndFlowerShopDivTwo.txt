Problem Statement

Fox Jiro came to a flower shop to buy flowers.
The flowers in the shop are arranged in some cells of a rectangular grid.
The layout of the grid is given as a String[]flowers.
If the j-th cell of the i-th row of the grid contains a flower, then the j-th character of the i-th element offlowerswill be 'F'.
(All indices in the previous sentence are 0-based.)
If the particular cell is empty, the corresponding character will be '.' (a period).

In order to buy flowers, Jiro has to draw a rectangle on this grid and buy all the flowers which lie inside the rectangle.
Of course, the sides of the rectangle must be on cell boundaries.
(Therefore, the sides of the rectangle will necessarily be parallel to the coordinate axes.)

Jiro wants to buy as many flowers as possible.
Unfortunately, he cannot select the entire grid.
Eel Saburo came to this shop before Jiro.
Saburo has already drawn his rectangle.
Saburo's rectangle contains just a single cell: thec-th cell of ther-th row of the grid.
(Again, both indices are 0-based.)
Jiro's rectangle may not contain this cell.

You are given the String[]flowersand the intsrandc.
Return the maximum possible number of flowers Jiro can buy in this situation.
