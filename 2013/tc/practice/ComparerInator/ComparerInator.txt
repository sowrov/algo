Problem Statement

Comparer-inator is a very simple language that is specialized in comparisons. It takes an expression and returns the result. There are only two kinds of expressions: a variable name or a tertiary operator inspired by C syntax (which is also used in many languages like Java, C++, and C#). We are interested to use this language to process two int[]s,AandBto generate the int[]wantedas a result. We have previously found that there are four candidate programs that could be an optimal way to solve the issue we have. Each of the programs takes two argumentsaandb."a" : This program will return the given argumenta."b" : This program will return the given argumentb."a<b?a:b" : If a is less than b, the program will returna, else it will returnb."a<b?b:a" : If a is less than b, the program will returnb, else it will returna.Given int[]A,Bandwantedfind the shortest of the four candidate programs that, for every index i, will returnwanted[i] after being provideda=A[i] andb=B[i] as arguments. Return the length of the shortest program. If no candidate program can do the required job, return -1 instead.  

Definition

Class:  ComparerInator  

Method:  makeProgram  

Parameters:  int[], int[], int[]  

Returns:  int  

Method signature:  int makeProgram(int[] A, int[] B, int[] wanted)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Constraints

-  Awill contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.  

-  Bandwantedwill each contain the same number of elements asA.  

-  Each element ofA,Bandwantedwill be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.  

Examples

0)  

{1}

{2}

{2}

Returns: 1

"b" and "a<b?b:a" (quotes for clarity) are the two programs that will return 2 after being givena=1,b=2 as arguments. "b" is the shortest of them.  

1)  

{1,3}

{2,1}

{2,3}

Returns: 7

"a<b?b:a" is the only program that will return 2 after being provideda=1,b=2 and will also
return 3 after being provideda=3,b=1.  

2)  

{1,3,5}

{2,1,7}

{2,3,5}

Returns: -1

None of the four programs can do the job correctly.  

3)  

{1,3,5}

{2,1,7}

{1,3,5}

Returns: 1

4)  

{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}

{5,4,7,8,3,1,1,2,3,4,6}

{1,2,3,4,3,1,1,2,3,4,6}

Returns: 7

5)  

{1,5,6,7,8}

{1,5,6,7,8}

{1,5,6,7,8}

Returns: 1

"a", "b", "a<b?a:b" and "a<b?b:a" are all valid programs that will give the wanted result. "a" and "b" are the shortest.
