Problem Statement

Farmer John and Fox Brus are participating in a programming contest as a team.The duration of the contest isTminutes and they are given N tasks. Solutions can be submitted at any time during the contest, including exactlyTminutes after the start of the contest. It takes themrequiredTime[i] minutes to solve the i-th task.The score in this contest is represented by two numbers,solvedandpenalty. Initially both numbers are 0. If they solve a task t minutes after the start of the contest,solvedincreases by 1 andpenaltyincreases by t. Two scores are compared bysolvedfirst. If two scores have differentsolved, the score with biggersolvedis better. If two scores have the samesolved, the score with smallerpenaltyis better.Return a int[] containing exactly two integers that describes the best score they can get. The first integer of the return value must representsolvedand the second integer must representpenalty.  

Definition

Class:  TheProgrammingContestDivTwo  

Method:  find  

Parameters:  int, int[]  

Returns:  int[]  

Method signature:  int[] find(int T, int[] requiredTime)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Constraints

-  Twill be between 1 and 100,000, inclusive.  

-  requiredTimewill contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.  

-  Each element ofrequiredTimewill be between 1 and 100,000, inclusive.  

Examples

0)  

74

{47}

Returns: {1, 47 }

They can solve the task.solvedwill be 1 andpenaltywill be 47.  

1)  

74

{4747}

Returns: {0, 0 }

They don't have time enough to solve the task.  

2)  

47

{8, 5}

Returns: {2, 18 }

The order is important. If they solve task 0 first and task 1 second,solvedwill be 2 andpenaltywill be 21. If they solve task 1 first and task 0 second,solvedwill be 2 andpenaltywill be 18.  

3)  

47

{12, 3, 21, 6, 4, 13}

Returns: {5, 86 }

4)  

58

{4, 5, 82, 3, 4, 65, 7, 6, 8, 7, 6, 4, 8, 7, 6, 37, 8}

Returns: {10, 249 }

5)  

100000

{100000}

Returns: {1, 100000 }
