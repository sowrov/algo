Problem Statement

Fox Ciel found two astronomical records.
They both describe the same solar system.
In this solar system each planet orbits the sun at some fixed distance, and those distances are distinct.
Each of the two records contains a comparison of some of those distances.The first record is a int[]Awith x elements.
These elements correspond to some x planets in the solar system.
The distances at which these planets orbit the sun have the ratioA[0] :A[1] : ... :A[x-1].
The planets described byAare ordered by their distance from the sun.(That is, earlier elements ofAcorrespond to planets that are closer to the sun.
Thus, the elements ofAwill always form a strictly increasing sequence.)The second record is a int[]Bwith y elements.
These elements correspond to some y planets in the solar system.
The distances at which these planets orbit the sun have the ratioB[0] :B[1] : ... :B[y-1].
The planets described byBare also ordered by their distance from the sun.Note that the planets mentioned in a record do not have to be consecutive.
For example, if a solar system contains the planets P, Q, R, S, T, and U, it is possible that the first record compares P, R, and S, and the second record compares Q, R, T, and U.We assume that both records are correct.
Return the smallest possible total number of planets in the solar system.  

Definition

Class:  AstronomicalRecordsEasy  

Method:  minimalPlanets  

Parameters:  int[], int[]

(be sure your method is public)  

Constraints

-  Awill contain between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.  

-  Bwill contain between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.  

-  Each element inAwill be between 1 and 1,000, inclusive.  

-  Each element inBwill be between 1 and 1,000, inclusive.  

-  Elements inAwill be strictly increasing.  

-  Elements inBwill be strictly increasing.  

Examples

0)  

{1,2,3,4}

{2,3,4,5}

Returns: 5

There have to be at least 4 planets, because each record compares 4 of them.
There cannot be exactly 4 planets, because 1:2:3:4 is not the same ratio as 2:3:4:5.
For example, the orbital radii of the two planets closest to the sun would have to have ratio 1:2 and at the same time ratio 2:3, which is impossible.
There can be exactly 5 planets with relative orbital radii 1,2,3,4,5.  

1)  

{1,2,3,4}

{2,4,6,8}

Returns: 4

In this case we can only have 4 stars, because 1:2:3:4 = 2:4:6:8.  

2)  

{1,2,3,5,6,8,9}

{2,4,5,6,7,8,9}

Returns: 9

One optimal solution: 1, 2, 3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7, 8, 9.  

3)  

{1,2,3,4}

{6,7,8,9}

Returns: 6

One optimal solution: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12.  

4)  

{200,500}

{100,200,300,400,600,700,800,900}

Returns: 9

5)  

{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}

{6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15}

Returns: 15
