Problem Statement

You are a wizard.
You are facing N fairies, numbered 0 through N-1.
Your goal is to defeat all of them.
You can only attack one fairy at a time.
Moreover, you must fight the fairies in order: you can only attack fairy X+1 after you defeat fairy X.
On the other hand, all fairies that have not been defeated yet will attack you all the time.Each fairy has two characteristics: her damage per second (dps) and her amount of hit points.
Your damage per second is 1.
That is, you are able to reduce an opponent's hit points by 1 each second.
In other words, if a fairy has H hit points, it takes you H seconds to defeat her.You are given two int[]s, each of length N:dpsandhp.
For each i,dps[i] is the damage per second of fairy i, andhp[i] is her initial amount of hit points.
We assume that your number of hit points is sufficiently large to avoid defeat when fighting the fairies.
Compute and return the total number of hit points you'll lose during the fight.
In other words, return the total amount of damage the attacking fairies will deal.  

Definition

Class:  GreatFairyWar  

Method:  minHP  

Parameters:  int[], int[]  

Returns:  int  

Method signature:  int minHP(int[] dps, int[] hp)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Notes

-  Damage per second (dps) of a person P is the rate at which P can deal damage to their opponents.  

Constraints

-  dpswill contain between 1 and 30 elements, inclusive.  

-  dpsandhpwill contain the same number of elements.  

-  Each element indpswill be between 1 and 30, inclusive.  

-  Each element inhpwill be between 1 and 30, inclusive.  

Examples

0)  

{1,2}

{3,4}

Returns: 17

It will take you 3 seconds to defeat fairy 0 and then 4 seconds to defeat fairy 1.
During the first 3 seconds both fairies attack you, dealing 1+2 = 3 damage each second.
During the next 4 seconds fairy 1 continues to attack you, dealing 2 damage each second.
The total number of hit points you lose is 3*(1+2) + 4*2 = 9 + 8 = 17.
