Problem Statement

One day, Fox Ciel looked at the words "tokyo" and "kyoto" and noticed an unusual property:
We can split "tokyo" into "to"+"kyo", and then swap those two parts to obtain "kyo"+"to" = "kyoto".Formally, let S and T be two different strings.
We call the pair (S,T)interestingif there are two non-empty strings A and B such that S = A+B and T = B+A.
For example, according to this definition, if S="tokyo" and T="kyoto", then the pair (S,T) is interesting, because we can find A="to" and B="kyo".You are given a String[]words.
Return the number of interesting pairs we can find among the elements ofwords.
Only count each pair once.
E.g., ("tokyo","kyoto") and ("kyoto","tokyo") is the same interesting pair.  

Definition

Class:  FoxAndWord  

Method:  howManyPairs  

Parameters:  String[]  

Returns:  int  

Method signature:  int howManyPairs(String[] words)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Constraints

-  wordswill contain between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.  

-  Each element ofwordswill contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.  

-  Each character in each element ofwordswill be a lowercase letter ('a'-'z').

Examples

0)  

{"tokyo", "kyoto"}

Returns: 1

As mentioned in the problem statement, ("tokyo", "kyoto") is an interesting pair.  

1)  

{"aaaaa", "bbbbb"}

Returns: 0

("aaaaa", "bbbbb") is not an interesting pair.  

2)  

{"ababab","bababa","aaabbb"}

Returns: 1

There is one interesting pair: ("ababab","bababa").
Note that for this interesting pair there is more than one way to choose the strings A and B.  

3)  

{"eel", "ele", "lee"}

Returns: 3

4)  

{"aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb"}
