Problem Statement

The highway extends endlessly headed east and west. Bob the chicken walks in a 
sequence of straight lines. Given Bob's path, we want to figure out 
how many times he crosses the road (assuming he doesn't become road kill).
We will not count it as a crossing if Bob moves onto the road, possibly wanders 
along the road, and then returns to the side he entered the road from.The road has negligible width, so it is just a horizontal line running along a given y coordinate.
Create a class FowlRoad that contains a method crossings that is givenroadY(the
y coordinate of the road), and int[]sbobXandbobYgiving Bob's path.  It should
return the number of times that Bob crosses the road.

The ith elements ofbobXandbobYgive the coordinates of a point in Bob's path.
Bob starts at the first point, and proceeds in a straight line to the next point,
continuing until he finishes at the last point. Bob does not start or end on the road.

Definition

Class:  FowlRoad  

Method:  crossings  

Parameters:  int, int[], int[]  

Returns:  int  

Method signature:  int crossings(int roadY, int[] bobX, int[] bobY)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Constraints

-  bobXcontains between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.  

-  bobYcontains the same number of elements asbobX.  

-  roadYand each element ofbobXand each element ofbobYis between -100 and 100, inclusive.  

-  Neither the first nor the last element ofbobYis equal toroadY.  

Examples

0)  

6

{3,7,9,2}

{-3,8,8,2}

Returns: 2

As Bob goes from (3,-3) to (7,8) he crosses the road. From (7,8) to (9,8) he is
   moving parallel to the road, not crossing it. But when he goes from (9,8) to 
   (2,2) he crosses the road again.

10

{3,7,9,2}

{-3,8,8,2}

Returns: 0

Bob wanders around on the south side of the road, never crossing it.  

2)  

0

{3,2,5,6,9}

{2,0,0,2,-88}

Returns: 1

Bob wanders from the north side onto the road, along the road, then back to
   the north side at (6,2). On his last segment he crosses the road from the
   north side to the south side.  

3)  

0

{3,2,5,6,9}

{-2,0,0,2,-88}

Returns: 2

This is the same as the preceding example except that Bob starts on the south
   side of the road at (3,-2). He wanders onto the road, along the road and then
   onto the north side thereby completing a crossing from south to north. On his 
   last segment he crosses the road from north to south.
