Problem Statement

Your friend the farmer liked to use the following method to count the number of beavers and ducks present on the farm: He would first find three intswebbedFeet,duckBillsandbeaverTails, representing  the number of webbed feet, duck bills and beaver tails he could count and then he used those numbers to find the number of ducks and beavers on the farm. (A duck has one duck bill and two webbed feet. A beaver has one beaver tail and four webbed feet.)The method worked great until he received news that there could be a platypus invasion on the farm. A platypus is a marvellous creature that has 4 webbed feet, a duck bill and a beaver tail. Our farmer is justifiably confused. Help him find out that his method is still useful. You are given intswebbedFeet,duckBillsandbeaverTailsthat specify the number of webbed feet, duck bills and beaver tails  the farmer has counted, respectively. Return the total number of animals (ducks, beavers, and platypuses) on the farm. The constraints guarantee that there will be exactly one solution.
