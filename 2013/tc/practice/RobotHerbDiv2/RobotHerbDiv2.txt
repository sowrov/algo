Problem Statement

Robot Herb is playing on an infinite square grid.
At any moment, Herb stands on one of the squares and he faces one of the four cardinal directions.
In his memory, Herb has a program.
The program is a sequence of commands.
For each i, the i-th of these commands has the following form:

First move forwarda[i] tiles.Then turn 90 degrees to the right,a[i] times in a row.Herb has decided to run the programTtimes.
You are given the intTand the int[]athat describes Herb's program.
Let A be the initial position of Herb and B be his position after the program was executedTtimes. Return the Manhattan distance between tiles A and B.

Definition

Class:  RobotHerbDiv2  

Method:  getdist  

Parameters:  int, int[]  

Returns:  int  

Method signature:  int getdist(int T, int[] a)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Notes

-  Let's introduce a Cartesian coordinate system on the grid so that each cardinal direction is parallel to one of the axes. The Manhattan distance between two tiles with centers at points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is defined as |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.  

Constraints

-  Twill be between 1 and 100, inclusive.  

-  awill contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.  

-  Each element ofawill be between 1 and 400,000, inclusive.  

Examples

0)  

1

{1,2,3}

Returns: 2

Suppose that initially Herb stands on the tile with center at (0, 0) and faces the positive y direction. The program will get executed as follows:tile         direction
After 1st command:     (0, 1)       positive x
After 2nd command:     (2, 1)       negative x
After 3rd command:     (-1, 1)      negative y

The manhattan distance between the initial and the final positions is |-1| + |1| = 2.  

1)  

100

{1}

Returns: 0

2)  

5

{1,1,2}

Returns: 10

3)  

100

{400000}

Returns: 40000000
