Problem Statement

This problem statement contains superscipts that may not display properly outside the applet.

You are given four intsA,B,CandD. Return "divisible" (quotes for clarity) ifABis divisible byCD. Return "not divisible" otherwise.  

Definition

Class:  BigFatInteger2  

Method:  isDivisible  

Parameters:  int, int, int, int  

Returns:  String  

Method signature:  String isDivisible(int A, int B, int C, int D)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Notes

-  The return value is case-sensitive.  

-  Positive integer y divides a positive integer x if and only if there is a positive integer z such that y*z=x. In particular, for each positive integer x, both 1 and x divide x.  

Constraints

-  A,B,CandDwill each be between 1 and 1,000,000,000 (109), inclusive.  

Examples

0)  

6

1

2

1

Returns: "divisible"

Here,AB= 61= 6 andCD= 21= 2. 6 is divisible by 2.

6

1

Returns: "not divisible"

2 is not divisible by 6.  

2)  

1000000000

1000000000

1000000000

200000000

Returns: "divisible"

Now the numbers are huge, but we can see thatABis divisible byCDfrom the fact thatA=CandB>D.  

3)  

8

100

4

200

Returns: "not divisible"

We can rewrite 8100as (23)100= 2300.
Similarly, 4200= (22)200= 2400.
Thus, 8100is not divisible by 4200.

1

Returns: "not divisible"

HereAandCare distinct prime numbers, which meansABcannot haveCas its divisor.
