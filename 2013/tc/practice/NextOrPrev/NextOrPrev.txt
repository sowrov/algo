Problem Statement

Consider a string consisting of lowercase characters and following two operations that can change it:Next: Choose a lowercase character other than 'z' and replace its every occurrence with the next character 
	('a' -> 'b', 'b' -> 'c', ..., 'x' -> 'y', 'y' -> 'z').Prev: Choose a lowercase character other than 'a' and replace its every occurrence with the previous character 
	('b' -> 'a', 'c' -> 'b', ..., 'y' -> 'x', 'z' -> 'y').You can use each operation as many times as you want, and in any order you like. 
You are given intsnextCostandprevCost. 
These represent the cost of using each Next and Prev operation, respectively. 
You are also given two Stringsstartandgoal. 
These strings are special: no two characters instartare the same, and no two characters ingoalare the same. 
Return the minimum cost required in order to transformstartintogoalusing the above operations. 
If transformingstartintogoalis impossible, return -1 instead.  

Definition

Class:  NextOrPrev  

Method:  getMinimum  

Parameters:  int, int, String, String  

Returns:  int  

Method signature:  int getMinimum(int nextCost, int prevCost, String start, String goal)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Constraints

-  nextCostandprevCostwill each be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.  

-  startandgoalwill each contain between 1 and 26 characters, inclusive.  

-  startandgoalwill contain the same number of characters.  

-  Each character instartandgoalwill be a lowercase character.  

-  The characters instartwill be distinct.  

-  The characters ingoalwill be distinct.  

Examples

0)

"ae"

"bc"

Returns: 21

There are several optimal sequences of operations. 
Here is one of them: "ae" -(Next)-> "be" -(Prev)-> "bd" -(Prev)-> "bc". The total cost is 5 + 8 + 8 = 21.

"ae"

"cb"

Returns: -1

It is impossible to transform "ae" into "cb".  

2)

"srm"

"srm"

Returns: 0

startandgoalmay be the same. 
The cost of an empty sequence of operations is 0.
