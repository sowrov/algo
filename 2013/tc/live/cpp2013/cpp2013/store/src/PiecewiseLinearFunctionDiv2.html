PROBLEM STATEMENT
F is a function that is defined on all real numbers from the closed interval [1,N].
You are given a vector <int> Y with N elements.
For each i (1 <= i <= N) we have F(i) = Y[i-1].
Additionally, you know that F is piecewise linear: for each i, on the interval [i,i+1] F is a linear function.
The function F is uniquely determined by this information.
For example, if F(4)=1 and F(5)=6 then we must have F(4.7)=4.5.

As another example, this is the plot of the function F for Y = {1, 4, -1, 2}.



You are also given a vector <int> query.
For each i, compute the number of solutions to the equation F(x) = query[i].
Note that sometimes this number of solutions can be infinite.

Return a vector <int> of the same length as query.
For each i, element i of the return value should be -1 if the equation F(x) = query[i] has an infinite number of solutions.
Otherwise, element i of the return value should be the actual number of solutions this equation has.

DEFINITION
Class:PiecewiseLinearFunctionDiv2
Method:countSolutions
Parameters:vector <int>, vector <int>
Returns:vector <int>
Method signature:vector <int> countSolutions(vector <int> Y, vector <int> query)


CONSTRAINTS
-Y will contain between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of Y will be between -1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive.
-query will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of query will be between -1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1, 4, -1, 2}
{-2, -1, 0, 1}

Returns: {0, 1, 2, 3 }

This is the example from the problem statement. The detailed information about the queries is:

There is no such x that F(x) = -2 is satisfied.
F(x) = -1 is only true for x = 3.
F(x) = 0 has two roots: 2.8 and 10/3.
F(x) = 1 has three roots: 1, 2.6 and 11/3.


1)
{0, 0}
{-1, 0, 1}

Returns: {0, -1, 0 }

This function's plot is a horizontal segment between points (1, 0) and (2, 0). F(x) = 0 is satisfied for any x between 1 and 2 and thus the number of solutions is infinite. For any other value on the right-hand side, it has no solutions.

2)
{2, 4, 8, 0, 3, -6, 10}
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 65536}

Returns: {3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0 }



3)
{-178080289, -771314989, -237251715, -949949900, -437883156, -835236871, -316363230, -929746634, -671700962}

{-673197622, -437883156, -251072978, 221380900, -771314989, -949949900, -910604034, -671700962, -929746634, -316363230}

Returns: {8, 6, 3, 0, 7, 1, 4, 8, 3, 4 }
